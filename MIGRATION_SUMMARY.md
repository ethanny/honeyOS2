# HoneyOS Whisper to Picovoice Migration Summary

## What Was Changed

### 1. Core Script Migration (`Assets/Scripts/MicrophoneDemo.cs`)
- **Replaced Whisper with Picovoice Rhino**: Changed from speech-to-text + command parsing to direct speech-to-intent recognition
- **Updated namespace**: Changed from `Whisper.Samples` to `HoneyOS.VoiceControl`
- **Replaced dependencies**: 
  - Removed `WhisperManager` and `MicrophoneRecord`
  - Added `RhinoManager` from `Pv.Unity`
- **Restructured command handling**: 
  - Changed from text-based command matching to intent-based actions
  - Renamed `commandDictionary` to `intentActionDictionary` with intent names as keys
- **Improved error handling**: Added try-catch blocks for Rhino initialization and operations
- **Enhanced VAD integration**: Integrated with new microphone manager for better voice activity detection

### 2. New Microphone Manager (`Assets/Scripts/PicovoiceMicrophoneManager.cs`)
- **Created replacement for MicrophoneRecord**: Handles microphone capture and voice activity detection
- **Built-in VAD**: Real-time voice activity detection using RMS calculation
- **Event system**: Provides callbacks for recording state changes
- **Unity-native**: Uses Unity's built-in Microphone class for cross-platform compatibility

### 3. Context Configuration (`Assets/StreamingAssets/honeyos_context.rhn`)
- **Created placeholder**: Template for Picovoice Console context creation
- **Mapped all commands**: Converted 25+ voice commands to structured intents
- **Organized by category**: App management, file operations, text editing, help navigation, scheduler operations, and simulation control

## What You Need to Do

### 1. Install Picovoice Unity SDK
```bash
# Download from: https://github.com/Picovoice/rhino/releases
# Import the .unitypackage file into your Unity project
```

### 2. Get Picovoice Access Key
1. Sign up at [Picovoice Console](https://console.picovoice.ai/)
2. Copy your Access Key
3. Paste it into the `accessKey` field in `MicrophoneDemo` script

### 3. Create Rhino Context
1. Go to Picovoice Console â†’ Rhino Speech-to-Intent
2. Create new context named "HoneyOS"
3. Add all intents from `PICOVOICE_SETUP.md`
4. Train the context
5. Download the `.rhn` file
6. Place it in `Assets/StreamingAssets/honeyos_context.rhn`

### 4. Remove Whisper Dependencies
- Remove Whisper Unity package
- Delete unused Whisper scripts and assets
- Clean up any remaining references

### 5. Update Unity Scene
- Ensure `MicrophoneDemo` script is attached to a GameObject
- The `PicovoiceMicrophoneManager` will be added automatically
- Configure the Inspector fields:
  - Set `accessKey` to your Picovoice key
  - Set `contextPath` to "honeyos_context.rhn"

## Benefits of the Migration

### Performance Improvements
- **Lower latency**: Direct intent recognition vs speech-to-text + parsing
- **Better accuracy**: Purpose-built for voice commands
- **On-device processing**: No internet dependency
- **Reduced CPU usage**: More efficient than general speech-to-text

### Development Benefits
- **Structured output**: Intents and slots instead of raw text
- **Better error handling**: Clear success/failure states
- **Easier maintenance**: Add new commands through Picovoice Console
- **Type safety**: Predefined intents reduce runtime errors

### User Experience
- **Faster response**: Immediate intent recognition
- **More reliable**: Less prone to misinterpretation
- **Privacy-focused**: All processing happens locally
- **Consistent behavior**: Deterministic intent matching

## Potential Issues and Solutions

### 1. Unity SDK Deprecation
- **Issue**: Picovoice Unity SDK will be deprecated after December 15, 2025
- **Solution**: Plan migration to native platform SDKs or alternative solutions before deadline

### 2. Context Limitations
- **Issue**: Free tier has usage limits
- **Solution**: Monitor usage and upgrade to paid plan if needed

### 3. Microphone Permissions
- **Issue**: Apps need microphone permissions
- **Solution**: Ensure proper permissions are requested in build settings

### 4. Platform Compatibility
- **Issue**: Picovoice supports specific platforms
- **Solution**: Verify target platforms are supported (Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, iOS)

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Picovoice SDK imported successfully
- [ ] Access key configured
- [ ] Context file in StreamingAssets folder
- [ ] All voice commands working
- [ ] VAD indicator functioning
- [ ] Spacebar input still works
- [ ] Error handling working
- [ ] No compilation errors
- [ ] Performance is acceptable
- [ ] All target platforms tested

## Next Steps

1. Follow the detailed setup guide in `PICOVOICE_SETUP.md`
2. Test all voice commands thoroughly
3. Optimize context for your specific use cases
4. Consider adding more sophisticated voice commands using slots
5. Plan for Unity SDK deprecation timeline
