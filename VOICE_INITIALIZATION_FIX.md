# Voice Initialization Fix Guide

## The Problem
Your voice initialization is failing because the access key is still set to the placeholder `"YOUR_NEW_ACCESS_KEY_HERE"`.

## Quick Fix Steps

### Step 1: Get a Fresh Picovoice Access Key
1. Go to [https://console.picovoice.ai/](https://console.picovoice.ai/)
2. Sign up for a free account (or log in if you have one)
3. Copy your AccessKey from the dashboard

### Step 2: Update Your Script
1. Open `Assets/Scripts/MicrophoneDemo.cs` in Unity
2. Find line 22: `public string accessKey = "YOUR_NEW_ACCESS_KEY_HERE";`
3. Replace `"YOUR_NEW_ACCESS_KEY_HERE"` with your actual access key in quotes
4. Example: `public string accessKey = "AbCdEf1234567890...";`

### Step 3: Test the Fix
1. In Unity, select the GameObject with the MicrophoneDemo script
2. In the Inspector, right-click on the script component
3. Choose "Diagnose Voice Initialization" from the context menu
4. Check the Console for diagnostic results

## Alternative: Set Access Key in Inspector
Instead of editing the script, you can:
1. Select the GameObject with MicrophoneDemo script
2. In the Inspector, find the "Access Key" field
3. Paste your access key directly there
4. Save the scene

## Expected Results
After setting a valid access key, you should see:
- ✅ ACCESS KEY STATUS: Valid format
- ✅ FILE STATUS: Context and model files found
- ✅ MICROPHONE STATUS: Device detected
- ✅ RHINO CREATION: SUCCESS!

## If You Still Get Errors

### Error 00000136 or 00000137
- Your access key is invalid or expired
- Get a fresh key from the Picovoice Console

### Missing Files Error
- Ensure these files exist in `Assets/StreamingAssets/`:
  - `rhino_params.pv`
  - `honeyos_context.rhn`

### No Microphone Error
- Connect a microphone to your computer
- Restart Unity
- Check Windows sound settings

## Testing Voice Commands
Once fixed, try these commands:
- "Open Sweet" (opens an app)
- "Save File" (saves current file)
- "Play Simulation" (starts simulation)
- Hold spacebar and speak any command
